									<h2><a href="#">Hi, my name is Ed</h2>
										<a class="image fit"><img src="images/pic02.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>I earned a Bachelor's degree in Information Systems from Kennesaw State University in late 2008. About a year later, I interviewed and accepted a position at The Home Depot where I am currently employed.
										I began by supporting the six fuel stores THD operated.  My duties included testing and upgrading applications used in-store by associates (ie: POS, backoffice system), resolving back office system and networking issues and loyalty functionality. 
										<br/>After being promoted, I began to take on additional responsibilites such as learning about and supporting point-of-sale (POS) and Self-Checkout (SCO) for the big box stores (~2200 stores and >10,000 SCOs).  Duties included troubleshooting SCO/POS software and/or hardware and providing support for new hardware rollout projects. 
										Over time, I became the SCO subject matter expert resolving a wide range of SCO issues.  I visited numerous stores across the country investigating various SCO issues and drove them to resolution. I was recognized as Employee of the Month for my efforts. In 2015, the company sold off the fuel stores and 100% of my responsibilites was centered around POS and SCO support. <br/>
										In addition to that, the company began adopting Agile methodologies.  Also during this change, I took on a role where I collected data and VALET metrics on a new self checkout upgrade project. After spending a large part of my career on the support side, I wanted to try things from the development side.  That's when I was presented with an opportunity to participate in a 3-month full stack JS bootcamp.  In order to participate in the program, you have to be
										in good standing (not be on a performance improvement plan) and demonstrate you were actively participating and following concepts to the best of your ability. In addition, progress reports were sent to managers as well. During my time in the program, I received positive feedback and remarks by my manager.  I was able to follow and understand the material that was being presented even though it was a fast paced environment that tried to cover as many topics as possible. 
										<br/> Once the program was over, I went back to the work I was doing when I went in. It wasn't until nearly a year later before I was able to make the transition. During that gap, I continued to learn at my leisure using Udemy courses and I continue to learn to this day.
